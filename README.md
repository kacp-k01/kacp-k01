Hi, I'm a Geoinformatics graduate, who found “informatics” part more interesting and decided to explore this path instead. 
Currently, student of Computer Science on Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology, going by myself ahead of the programme, taking extra courses, 
focusing on the ones essential for becoming Java Software Engineere.
